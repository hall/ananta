MK(10.1)                                                    MK(10.1)

NAME
       mk - maintain (make) related files

SYNOPSIS
       mk [ -f mkfile ] ...  [ option ...  ] [ target ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Mk  uses  the dependency rules specified in mkfile to control
       the update  (usually  by  compilation)  of  targets  (usually
       files)  from  the  source  files upon which they depend.  The
       mkfile (default contains a rule for each target that  identi‐
       fies the files and other targets upon which it depends and an
       rc(10.1) script, a recipe, to update the target.  The  script
       is  run  if  the target does not exist or if it is older than
       any of the files it depends  on.   Mkfile  may  also  contain
       meta-rules that define actions for updating implicit targets.
       If no target is specified, the target of the first rule  (not
       meta-rule) in mkfile is updated.

       The  environment  variable $NPROC determines how many targets
       may be updated simultaneously; Plan 9 sets  $NPROC  automati‐
       cally to the number of CPUs on the current machine.

       Options are:

       -a      Assume  all  targets to be out of date.  Thus, every‐
               thing is updated.
       -d[egp] Produce debugging output (p is  for  parsing,  g  for
               graph building, e for execution).
       -e      Explain why each target is made.
       -i      Force any missing intermediate targets to be made.
       -k      Do as much work as possible in the face of errors.
       -n      Print,  but  do  not  execute, the commands needed to
               update the targets.
       -s      Make the command line arguments  sequentially  rather
               than in parallel.
       -t      Touch  (update  the  modified  date of) file targets,
               without executing any recipes.
       -wtarget1,target2,...
               Pretend the modify time for each target is  the  cur‐
               rent  time;  useful  in  conjunction with -n to learn
               what updates would be triggered by modifying the tar‐
               gets.

   The mkfile
       A  mkfile  consists of assignments (described under `Environ‐
       ment') and rules.  A rule contains targets  and  a  tail.   A
       target  is a literal string and is normally a file name.  The
       tail contains zero or  more  prerequisites  and  an  optional
       recipe,  which is an rc script.  Each line of the recipe must
       begin with white space.  A rule takes the form

              target: prereq1 prereq2
                      rc recipe using prereq1, prereq2 to build target

       When the recipe is executed, the  first  character  on  every
       line is elided.

       After  the  colon  on  the  target  line,  a rule may specify
       attributes, described below.

       A meta-rule has a target of the form A%B where A  and  B  are
       (possibly empty) strings.  A meta-rule acts as a rule for any
       potential target whose name matches A%B with % replaced by an
       arbitrary  string,  called the stem.  In interpreting a meta-
       rule, the stem is substituted for all occurrences of % in the
       prerequisite  names.  In the recipe of a meta-rule, the envi‐
       ronment variable $stem contains the string matched by the  %.
       For  example,  a  meta-rule  to  compile  a  C  program using
       2c(10.1) might be:

              %.2:    %.c
                      2c $stem.c
                      2l -o $stem $stem.2

       Meta-rules may contain an ampersand & rather than  a  percent
       sign  %.   A % matches a maximal length string of any charac‐
       ters; an & matches a maximal length string of any  characters
       except period or slash.

       The text of the mkfile is processed as follows.  Lines begin‐
       ning with < followed by a file name are replaced by the  con‐
       tents of the named file.  Blank lines and comments, which run
       from unquoted # characters  to  the  following  newline,  are
       deleted.    The   character   sequence  backslash-newline  is
       deleted, so long lines in mkfile may be  folded.   Non-recipe
       lines are processed by substituting for `{command} the output
       of the command when run by rc.  References to  variables  are
       replaced by the variables' values.  Special characters may be
       quoted using single quotes '' as in rc(10.1).

       Assignments and rules are distinguished by the first unquoted
       occurrence of : (rule) or = (assignment).

       A  later  rule  may modify or override an existing rule under
       the following conditions:

       -      If the targets of the rules exactly match and one rule
              contains only a prerequisite clause and no recipe, the
              clause is added to  the  prerequisites  of  the  other
              rule.   If  either  or  both  targets are virtual, the
              recipe is always executed.

       -      If the targets of the rules match exactly and the pre‐
              requisites   do  not  match  and  both  rules  contain
              recipes, mk reports an ``ambiguous recipe'' error.

       -      If the target and prerequisites of  both  rules  match
              exactly, the second rule overrides the first.

   Environment
       Rules may make use of rc environment variables.  A legal ref‐
       erence of  the  form  $OBJ  or  ${name}  is  expanded  as  in
       rc(10.1).   A reference of the form ${name:A%B=C%D}, where A,
       B, C, D are (possibly empty) strings, has the value formed by
       expanding  $name and substituting C for A and D for B in each
       word in $name that matches pattern A%B.

       Variables can be set by assignments of the form
               var=[attr=]value
       Blanks in the value break it into words, as in rc but without
       the  surrounding parentheses.  Such variables are exported to
       the environment of recipes as they are  executed,  unless  U,
       the only legal attribute attr, is present.  The initial value
       of a variable is taken from (in increasing  order  of  prece‐
       dence)  the  default  values  below,  mk's  environment,  the
       mkfiles, and any command line assignment as  an  argument  to
       mk.   A variable assignment argument overrides the first (but
       not any subsequent) assignment to that variable.   The  vari‐
       able  MKFLAGS  contains  all  the option arguments (arguments
       starting with or containing and MKARGS contains all the  tar‐
       gets in the call to mk.

       It is recommended that mkfiles start with

              </$objtype/mkfile

       to  set CC, LD, AS, O, ALEF, YACC, and MK to values appropri‐
       ate to the target architecture (see the examples below).

       Dynamic information may be included in the mkfile by using  a
       line of the form
               <| command args
       This  runs  the command command with the given arguments args
       and pipes its standard output to mk to be included as part of
       the  mkfile.  For  instance,  the file /os/sa1100/mkfile uses
       this technique to run a shell command with an awk script  and
       a configuration file as arguments in order for the awk script
       to process the file and output a set of variables  and  their
       values.

   Execution
       During   execution,  mk  determines  which  targets  must  be
       updated, and in what order, to build the names  specified  on
       the command line.  It then runs the associated recipes.

       A  target is considered up to date if it has no prerequisites
       or if all its prerequisites are up to date and  it  is  newer
       than all its prerequisites.  Once the recipe for a target has
       executed, the target is considered up to date.

       The date stamp used to determine if a target is up to date is
       computed  differently  for  different types of targets.  If a
       target  is  virtual  (the  target  of  a  rule  with  the   V
       attribute), its date stamp is initially zero; when the target
       is updated the date stamp is set  to  the  most  recent  date
       stamp  of its prerequisites.  Otherwise, if a target does not
       exist as a file, its date stamp is set  to  the  most  recent
       date stamp of its prerequisites, or zero if it has no prereq‐
       uisites.  Otherwise, the target is the name of a file and the
       target's  date stamp is always that file's modification date.
       The date stamp is computed when the target is needed  in  the
       execution of a rule; it is not a static value.

       Nonexistent  targets  that  have  prerequisites and are them‐
       selves prerequisites are treated specially.  Such a target  t
       is  given  the date stamp of its most recent prerequisite and
       if this causes all the targets which have t as a prerequisite
       to  be  up to date, t is considered up to date.  Otherwise, t
       is made in the normal fashion.  The -i  flag  overrides  this
       special treatment.

       Files  may  be  made in any order that respects the preceding
       restrictions.

       A recipe is executed by  supplying  the  recipe  as  standard
       input to the command
               $SHELL -e -I
       where the SHELL variable is the appropriate shell on the cur‐
       rent platform - typically /bin/sh or /bin/rc.  The  appropri‐
       ate  value  is  automatically  supplied  in the Inferno build
       environment.  The -e is omitted if the E  attribute  is  set.
       The environment is augmented by the following variables:

       $alltarget    all the targets of this rule.

       $newprereq    the prerequisites that caused this rule to exe‐
                     cute.

       $nproc        the process slot for this recipe.  It satisfies
                     0≤$nproc<$NPROC.

       $pid          the process id for the mk executing the recipe.

       $prereq       all the prerequisites for this rule.

       $stem         if  this  is  a  meta-rule, $stem is the string
                     that matched % or &.  Otherwise, it  is  empty.
                     For  regular expression meta-rules (see below),
                     the variables are set to the corresponding sub‐
                     expressions.

       $target       the  targets  for  this  rule  that  need to be
                     remade.

       These variables are available only during the execution of  a
       recipe, not while evaluating the mkfile.

       Unless  the  rule  has the Q attribute, the recipe is printed
       prior to execution with  recognizable  environment  variables
       expanded.  Commands returning error status cause mk to termi‐
       nate.

       Recipes and backquoted rc commands in places such as  assign‐
       ments  execute  in  a  copy of mk's environment; changes they
       make to environment variables are not visible from mk.

       Variable substitution in a rule is  done  when  the  rule  is
       read;  variable  substitution  in the recipe is done when the
       recipe is executed.  For example:

              bar=a.c
              foo:    $bar
                      $CC -o foo $bar
              bar=b.c

       will compile b.c into foo, if a.c is newer than foo.

   Aggregates
       Names of the form a(b) refer to member b of the aggregate  a.
       Currently,  the  only  aggregates  supported are ar(10.1) ar‐
       chives.

   Attributes
       The colon separating the target from the prerequisites may be
       immediately  followed  by  attributes and another colon.  The
       attributes are:

       D      If the recipe exits with a non-null status, the target
              is deleted.

       E      Continue execution if the recipe draws errors.

       N      If  there  is  no  recipe,  the  target  has  its time
              updated.

       n      The rule is a meta-rule that cannot be a target  of  a
              virtual  rule.   Only  files  match the pattern in the
              target.

       P      The characters after the P until the terminating : are
              taken  as a program name.  It will be invoked as rc -c
              prog 'arg1' 'arg2' and should return a null exit  sta‐
              tus  if  and  only  if  arg1  is  not out of date with
              respect to arg2.  Date stamps are still propagated  in
              the normal way.

       Q      The recipe is not printed prior to execution.

       R      The rule is a meta-rule using regular expressions.  In
              the rule, % has no special  meaning.   The  target  is
              interpreted as a regular expression as defined in reg‐
              exp(6).  The prerequisites may contain  references  to
              subexpressions  in  form \n, as in the substitute com‐
              mand of sed(10.1).

       U      The targets are considered to have been  updated  even
              if the recipe did not do so.

       V      The  targets of this rule are marked as virtual.  They
              are distinct from files of the same name.

EXAMPLES
       A simple mkfile to compile a program:

              </$objtype/mkfile

              prog:   a.$O b.$O c.$O
                  $LD $CFLAGS -o $target $prereq

              %.$O:   %.c
                  $CC $stem.c

       Override flag settings in the mkfile:

              % mk target 'CFLAGS=-S -w'

       To get the prerequisites for an aggregate:

              % membername 'libc.a(read.2)' 'libc.a(write.2)'
              read.2 write.2

       Maintain a library:

              libc.a(%.$O):N: %.$O
              libc.a: libc.a(abs.$O) libc.a(access.$O) libc.a(alarm.$O) ...
                  names=`{membername $newprereq}
                  ar r libc.a $names && rm $names

       String expression variables to derive  names  from  a  master
       list:

              NAMES=alloc arc bquote builtins expand main match mk var word
              OBJ=${NAMES:%=%.$O}

       Regular expression meta-rules:

              ([^/]*)/(.*)\.o:R:  \1/\2.c
                   cd $stem1; $CC $CFLAGS $stem2.c

       A  correct  way  to  deal with yacc(10.1) grammars.  The file
       lex.c includes the file x.tab.h rather than y.tab.h in  order
       to reflect changes in content, not just modification time.

              lex.o:           x.tab.h
              x.tab.h:         y.tab.h
                  cmp -s x.tab.h y.tab.h || cp y.tab.h x.tab.h
              y.tab.c y.tab.h: gram.y
                  $YACC -d gram.y

       The  above  example  could  also  use the P attribute for the
       x.tab.h rule:

              x.tab.h:Pcmp -s: y.tab.h
                   cp y.tab.h x.tab.h

BUGS
       Identical recipes for regular expression meta-rules only have
       one target.
       Seemingly  appropriate input like CFLAGS=-DHZ=60 is parsed as
       an erroneous attribute; correct it by inserting a space after
       the first
       The  recipes printed by mk before being passed to rc for exe‐
       cution  are  sometimes  erroneously  expanded  for  printing.
       Don't trust what's printed; rely on what rc does.
