CAL(1)                 General Commands Manual                CAL(1)

NAME
       cal - print calendar

SYNOPSIS
       cal [ month ] [ year ]

DESCRIPTION
       Cal  prints  a  calendar.  Month is either a number from 1 to
       12, a lower case month name, or  a  lower  case  three-letter
       prefix  of a month name.  Year can be between 1 and 9999.  If
       either month or year is omitted, the current month or year is
       used.   If  only  one  argument  is given, and it is a number
       larger than 12, a calendar for all twelve months of the given
       year  is produced; otherwise a calendar for just one month is
       printed.  The calendar produced is that for England  and  her
       colonies.

       Try
            cal sep 1752

BUGS
       The year is always considered to start in January even though
       this is historically naive.
       Beware that refers to the early Christian era, not  the  20th
       century.
